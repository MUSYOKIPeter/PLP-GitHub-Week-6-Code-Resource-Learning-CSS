// [1] let i = 0;: This line initializes a variable i with a value of 0. This is the starting point for our loop. [2] while (i < 6) { ... }: This is the while loop. It checks a condition (i < 6) before each iteration. If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the loop is executed. If the condition evaluates to false, the loop terminates. [3] console.log(The value of i = ${i});: This line logs the current value of i to the console. The value of i is embedded within a string using template literals (${i}). [4] i++;: This line increments the value of i by 1 after each iteration of the loop. This ensures that the loop eventually terminates when i becomes greater than or equal to 6. [7] So, when you run this code, it will print the following to the console: The value of i = 0. The value of i = 1. The value of i = 2. The value of i = 3. The value of i = 4. The value of i = 5. [8] After the i variable reaches 6, the condition i < 6 becomes false, and the loop stops.
