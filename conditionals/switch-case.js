//[1] let age = 15;: This line declares a variable named age and assigns it a value of 15. [2] switch (age) { ... }: The switch statement is a control flow statement that evaluates an expression (in this case, age) and executes code based on matching cases. [3] case 10:: This is a case label. It checks if the value of age is equal to 10. If it matches, the code inside this case block is executed. [4] console.log('Age is 10');: This line prints "Age is 10" to the console if age is 10.[5] break;: This statement is used to exit the switch statement once a case is matched and executed. Without break, the code execution would continue into the next case. [6] case 20:: This is another case label. It checks if the value of age is equal to 20. If it matches, the code inside this case block is executed. [7] console.log('Age is 20');: This line prints "Age is 20" to the console if age is 20. [8] default:: This is the default case. If none of the previous cases match, the code inside this block is executed. [9] console.log('Age is neither 10 or 20');: This line prints "Age is neither 10 or 20" to the console if age is neither 10 nor 20. [10] In this example, since age is 15, it doesn't match either case 10 or case 20, so the code inside the default block is executed, and "Age is neither 10 or 20" will be printed to the console.
