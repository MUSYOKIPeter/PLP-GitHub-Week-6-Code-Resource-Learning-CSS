// A language processor such as Node.js executes statements in a top-down approach. The statement written in the first line will be executed before the second line, then continue down to the last line:

console.log('Hello World!');
console.log("I'm learning JavaScript.");

// Printing numbers
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3); 


// Let's break down the provided JavaScript code step by step: [1] First console.log() Statement: console.log('Hello World!'); - This line of code prints the string 'Hello World!' to the console. [2] Second console.log() Statement: console.log("I'm learning JavaScript"); - This line of code prints the string "I'm learning JavaScript" to the console. [3] Third console.log() Statement: console.log(1); - This line of code prints the number 1 to the console. [4] Fourth console.log() Statement: console.log(2); - This line of code prints the number 2 to the console. [5] Fifth console.log() Statement: console.log(3); - This line of code prints the number 3 to the console. [//6//] When you run this JavaScript code, the console output will be as follows: Hello World! I'm learning JavaScript. 1 2 3 - Each console.log() statement is executed sequentially, one after another, printing its respective output to the console. Therefore, the output reflects the execution flow of the code, with each statement being executed in the order they appear.
